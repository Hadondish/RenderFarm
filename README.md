# RenderFarm
The infrastructure provided is a distributed system consisting of clusters of rendering computes. The input is a desired image. The dashboard shows the different compute clusters on different time vectors. This system increases potential for more efficient, dynamic compute along a system to rasterize a high dimensional image.
