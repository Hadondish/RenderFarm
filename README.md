# RenderFarm
The infrastructure provided is a distributed system consisting of clusters of rendering computes. The input is a desired image. The dashboard shows the different compute clusters on different time vectors. This system increases potential for more efficient, dynamic compute along a system to rasterize a high dimensional image.
Given an image, a scalable compute is made to address consistent bottlenecks in behaviour. A chord ring may be used to calculate appropriate timing locks to prevent deadlocks.

Next Steps: New semantic compiler for image through multimodal parsing, Networking measurements for lower latency, configured ASICs for GPU clusters.

Tech Stack: Ray, Python, Lambda Labs, Apache Spark, Hadoop
GPU Clusters by NVIDIA.
